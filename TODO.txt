*CURRENT PROGRAM VERSION: alpha_0.2

BUGS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: Nonfatal threading error upon client QUIT; program terminates, but outputs
    ugly threading error to terminal.

    -Cause might be the OS terminating the program while the Receive thread is
    running, so a solution may be to send the quit message to both Threads
    and terminate both, then terminate the program once both have stopped
    individually.

2: Arguable bug: when the server quits, the message sent to users that contact
    has been lost with the server is prepended with the client's username,
    when perhaps it should be prepended with the server's username.

3: Big bug: on Windows the filenames for the server logs contain invalid characters;
    a new naming convention will have to be implemented in order to get the server
    to run cross-platform.


FEATURES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Implement a session history that preserves the messages of a session,
    which allows previous messages to be displayed to clients when they
    join a server.

    -This is currently implemented and working in alpha_0.1 on MacOS, 
    but does not render history text to the GUI on Windows.
    -This is currently implemented in alpha_0.2 and confirmed working
    on MacOS; to be tested on different systems.

2. Implement a user authentication system, 
    with users and passwords being
    stored on the server computer. Allow guest
    users to join, but allow features such as
    'friends', 'saved-servers', etc. for
    members with saved profiles.

3. Implement server-side a reserved-usernames system that prevents clients from
    giving themselves certain usernames, such as 'ADMIN' or 'SERVER' or other
    active clients' usernames.

3. Stylize the GUI interface, as it is currently styled by 
    the OS default settings. Perhaps create a menu in the
    GUI for styling it locally as the user wishes.

    -( Minor styling done in alpha_0.1)
    -( Minor styling done in alpha_0.2)

4. Implement a 'Saved Servers' tab in the GUI which 
    allows quick access to servers.

5. Allow for an option to run the program in headless mode,
    hiding the terminal window from view. Perhaps enable toggling
    this from the GUI.

6. Support emojis.
