BUGS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Fix duplicated '...left the chatroom.' messages upon client exit.

2. Fix the various errors caused by client exit, which are currently
    handled with try...except blocks which output an error message without
    terminating the server program.


FEATURES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Implement a session history that preserves the messages of a session,
    which allows previous messages to be displayed to clients when they
    join a server.

2. Implement a user authentication system, 
    with users and passwords being
    stored on the server computer.

3. Stylize the GUI interface, as it is currently styled by 
    the OS default settings. Perhaps create a menu in the
    GUI for styling it locally as the user wishes.

4. Implement a 'Saved Servers' tab in the GUI which 
    allows quick access to servers.

5. Allow for an option to run the program in headless mode,
    hiding the terminal window from view. Perhaps enable toggling
    this from the GUI.

6. Support emojis.
